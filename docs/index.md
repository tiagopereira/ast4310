# Introduction

These pages contain a description of AST4310 and additional resources. The pages [at the University web site](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST4310/h25/index.html) will still be updated (in particular the messages), but the bulk of the materials will be linked here.

## Practicalities

- Four hours of lectures and two hours of exercise classes per week (see [calendar](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST4310/h25/timeplan/index.html))
- Classes will be held in person unless otherwise directed
- See separate page for [syllabus and literature](literature.md)
- The [course's github repository](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310) contains all project notebooks, and will be populated with additional resources as the semester progresses

## Communication
- If you want to place questions about any aspect of AST4310, we expect to have a Discourse forum available. Check this page for updates.

## Assessment

The final grade is determined by an assessment of three projects (50% of grade), and an oral exam (50% of grade). The following table lists deadlines for handing in each project, how much each project weighs in the final grade, and the topic of each project. More details can be found under [projects](projects.md). 

|        | Deadline          | Weight  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :----:|
| Project 1  | 19 Sep | 15% |
| Project 2  | 24 Oct | 15% |
| Project 3  | 28 Nov | 20% |

## Required software and tools

This course will have a strong computational component. Computations are not the end goal, but they will be an important tool to understand the topics we will cover. Research in astrophysics is becoming more and more computational; the course will equip students with the strategies and skills to deal with modern astrophysical problems. 

Students are expected to have their own laptops, and bring them to classes (including lectures!).

The projects are in the Julia programming language in Jupyter notebook format. More details about the software and computing environment can be found in [software and tools](tools.md).
