    "A model atmosphere is a basic building block to interpret radiation from stars. Different types of models exist, mostly in geometries of 1D plane-parallel, 1D spherical, or 3D (either cartesian or spherical). In this project you will work with a 3D cartesian model ran with the [Stagger code](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...970...24S/abstract) code, and a 1D plane-parallel model of the Sun known as [FALC](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...406..319F/abstract)\n",

    "A model atmosphere consists of a bunch of thermodynamical variables such as temperature, density, velocity, etc. These are usually tabled in a *depth* scale, meaning that the first point in the z axis is the top of the atmosphere, and the last point is deeper in the star. Normally, together with an appropriate equation of state, quantities such as electron density, hydrogen density, etc. can be provided as well. \n",

Their study of plasma constrained by magnetic fields have had a deep impact in various fields, from planetary formation to the very finest scales in stellar surfaces. In particular, their prolific work on convection in the atmospheres of cool stars has led to a paradigm shift from seeing stellar atmospheres as static 1D plane-parallel objects to highly-dynamic 3D atmospheres. Their seminal work [Simulations of Solar Granulation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...499..914S) triggered a new age in the study of the solar and stellar atmospheres, where spectral calculations from 3D MHD simulations of convection became feasible and challenged our understanding of stellar spectra. Using such simulations, the solar metallicity,  stable during decades of modelling and observations, was suddenly challenged and revised by almost half by [Asplund et al. (2005)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ASPC..336...25A). The codes developed by Nordlund and Stein have thrived and continued to be developed and updated at many research groups. They were at the origin of the Bifrost code, actively developed at the University of Oslo. Photographs from the web.*\n",

    "1D plane-parallel models are horizontally homogeneous and in hydrostatic equilibrium (\"time independent\"). Of course, stellar atmospheres are neither homogeneous nor static. A more realistic description of a stellar atmosphere is given by time-dependent, radiative 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. They can capture more physics, such as a realistic treatment of convection and radiation at different depths, and don't need the fudge factors such as microturbulence to make the spectra look like the observations. \n",

    "When we have a model atmosphere and calculate the radiation coming out of it, we call these synthetic spectra (as opposed to observed spectra). To obtain the synthetic spectrum of a model, we need to solve the radiative transfer throughout the atmosphere. In this project, you will calculate only the emergent radiation ($I_\\lambda^+$ or $\\mathcal{F}_\\lambda^+$) by using the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation.

In this particular case, we want a value of $\\tau$ for each height point, so for every point we integrate $\\alpha_\\lambda$ *up to that point*, and not across the whole range of heights.

The brilliant suggestion that H$^-$ might cause this extinction, instead of the ensemble of unknown metal edges that was earlier postulated, had already been given by [Pannekoek (1930)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1930MNRAS..91..139P), but was forgotten until it came independently from [Wildt (1939)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1939ApJ....89..295W). The proof came with Chandrasekhar's laborious quantum mechanical evaluation and explained how the solar atmosphere can be opaque at gas densities much lower than the transparent air around us, as you found in the previous exercise. It revolutionised the understanding of cool-star atmospheres by much increasing their hydrogen-to-metals ratio and gas pressure compared with the earlier metallic-absorption modeling of Biermann, Uns&ouml;ld and Pannekoek himself.

    "*Albrecht O.J. Uns&ouml;ld (1905-1995) was the first, in 1941 at Kiel, to study stellar composition (\"abundance analysis\")  in the detail permitted by proper physical understanding of line formation (for the B0 dwarf $\\tau$ Scorpii, using spectrograms taken during a six-month visit to the US just before the second world war).  He used the so-called \"coarse\" analysis based on Minnaert's curve of growth for a Schuster-Schwarzschild single \"reversing layer\".  Later, he led a school of astrophysicists at Kiel in \"fine analysis\", combining LTE line formation with non-grey stratified atmosphere modeling just as you do in this project.  The technique was developed by L.H. Aller, C. de Jager and others in the fifties, and has dominated stellar abundance analysis throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He spelled out its physical basis in great detail in his [\"Physik der Sternatmosph&auml;ren\"](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1955psmb.book.....U).

To obtain $n_l$, we first need to know $N_E$, the number density of atoms from element E, then how many of those are in ionisation stage $r$, and finally of those how many are in level $l$. $n_E$ is usually known by its ratio to the hydrogen number density, $N_H$.

Extending the wavelength range too much, and we are mostly computing continuum, which is a waste of time.
