    "By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, we can study how the scattering and absorption in the medium affect the intensity measured at the top of the box (after crossing the medium). We simulate photons being emitted in pixels given by the mask above, initially all in the vertical direction. After a photon travels an optical depth of $\\tau_0$, it will interact with matter and suffer one of two outcomes: be absorbed (destroyed) or be scattered. Scattered photons should be given a random new direction of travel, and then travel a new optical depth of $\\tau_1$ until they have another interaction with matter. This simulation of the photon trajectory should end when the photon is absorbed or it exits the box. Photons that exit through the sides or bottom are ignored, and photons that cross the top boundary are recorded. We use these to build an image of the intensity at the top of the box. \n",

The type of interaction (absorption or scattering) will also be probabilistically determined, based on the photon destruction probability $\\varepsilon$.\n",
