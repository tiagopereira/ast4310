It aims to be as fast as C and as easy to code as Python. In fact, writing Julia code can be remarkably similar to Python, but there are a few important differences to be aware. </p> <p>Here, we highlight how to perform some basic tasks with Julia, and how they compare with their Python equivalent. But first, a quick primer on what Julia is.</p>"},{"location":"julia/#julia-in-nutshell","title":"Julia in nutshell","text":"<p>Julia is a dynamically-typed language that feels more like a scripting language (e.g. Python) than a compiled language (e.g. C, Fortran). However, code in Julia is indeed compiled, but this step is hidden from the user by using just-in-time compilation. It works similar to Numba in Python. A difference is that Numba can be used with a very limited set of libraries/functions, while Julia is much more general. </p> <p>Julia can be run interactively from a terminal or a Jupyter notebook. The Julia terminal programme is referred to as REPL. A julia programme can also be run as a script, or placed in a package. Julia has its own package manager that is very easy to use.</p> <p>A key feature of Julia is called multiple dispatch. With multiple dispatch, Julia can split a function in several versions that are optimised for different inputs. For example, a multiplication function can have a version optimised for integers and another version optimised for floating point numbers. When a user calls that function, Julia automatically dispatches the call to the optimal function. In Julia, unlike Python, you can define the same function name multiple times and this will not cause problems, as long as each version has an input with a different data type.</p>"},{"location":"julia/#julia-for-python-programmers","title":"Julia for Python programmers","text":"<p>Read the manual on important differences from Python.
